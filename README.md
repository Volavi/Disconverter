# üé• Disconverter ‚Äì Video Compressor for Discord-Unfriendly Media

A simple **GUI** and **CLI** tool that converts and compresses videos to be Discord-friendly ‚Äî **under 10MB** and **universally playable** (H.264).

## ‚ú® What's New

* **Sleek user interface** with progress bar, file tracking, and debug console
* Remembers processed files with file hashing
* Still includes the **original lightweight script**: `disconvert-light.py`

---

## ü§î Why I Made This

* Videos from sites like **Ylilauta.org** wouldn‚Äôt play in Discord
* Needed to **bypass Discord‚Äôs 8MB/10MB upload limit** without Nitro
* Got tired of **manually converting files** or relying on janky websites like 8mb.video

## üöÄ What It Does

1. Goes through all files in a chosen folder
2. Converts non-H.264 videos to H.264 (compatible everywhere)
3. Creates compressed versions under 10MB for Discord sharing
4. Skips already-processed files using smart file hashing
5. Provides a **simple interface** for batch processing with optional debug output
